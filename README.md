# Overview
Cryptolotto is a powered by Ethereum DApp (decentralized application). The backend code is running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network and is presented by 12 smart contracts and a front-end. Cryptolotto works autonomously and with no entity controlling the key functions. The Cryptolotto's data and records of operation are cryptographically stored in a public, decentralized Ethereum blockchain network.

The main idea of Cryptolotto is straightforward: people from all over the world contribute equal amounts of ETH to one wallet during the set period of time. When a timer ends, this smart-contract powered wallet automatically sends all received ETH to one randomly chosen wallet-participant.

# The algorithm of picking a winner

```sh
    }
    
    function randomNumber(uint min, uint max) public constant returns (uint) {
        uint random = uint(keccak256(
            block.timestamp * 
            block.difficulty * 
            block.number *
            uint(block.blockhash(block.number - 1))
        ))%10 + 1;
       
        uint result = uint(keccak256(random))%(min+max)-min;
        
        if (result > max) {
            return max;
        }
        
        if (result < min) {
            return min;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
```
> Each wallet-participant gets `${uint _number}` when he joins the game. Random number determination depends on current block timestamp, block difficulty, block number and previous block hash. We set determination between min and max values. Additional conditions, in case something goes wrong, are set to prevent contract from sending Jackpot to invalid address.
